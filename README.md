As I have just a JSON server to make an API, So to start the server, you just have to run the command 'json-server --watch db.json' If this not work, then please run install json server: 'npm install -g json-server'
In this project, I have used Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion for styling purposes. Redux is for state management.



This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
